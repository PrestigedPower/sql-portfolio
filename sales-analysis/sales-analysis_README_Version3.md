# Sales Analysis

This project includes SQL scripts to help analyze sales data. It demonstrates how to create tables, insert sample data, and run queries to generate useful sales reports.

## Contents

- `schema.sql`: Defines the tables used for sales analysis.
- `sample_data.sql`: Inserts sample sales data for testing.
- `queries.sql`: Example queries for sales reporting and insight.

## Usage

1. Run `schema.sql` to create tables.
2. Run `sample_data.sql` to populate tables with sample data.
3. Use the queries in `queries.sql` to analyze and report on sales.

You can adapt this structure for your own datasets and analysis needs.
